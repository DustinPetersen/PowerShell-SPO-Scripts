Short PowerShell script to force external users to accept sharing invitations with the same account that the invitations were sent to. The script uses CSOM, tenant object property RequireAcceptingAccountMatchInvitedAccount,  and requires SharePoint Online SDK.

It is one of the 3 additional settings:

- Limit external sharing using domains 
- Prevent external users from sharing files, folders, and sites that they donâ€™t own 
- External users must accept sharing invitations using the same account that the invitations were sent to


 

The script is related to and more described in a Wiki article [SharePoint Online Sharing settings with CSOM](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/39365.sharepoint-online-sharing-settings-with-csom).
