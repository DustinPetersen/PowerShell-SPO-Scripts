A short script to get a list of all site collections and their subsites, and their subsites' subsites and the subsites... etc.

 

If you run it in ISE you can easily copy-paste the results and search through them.

Does not require any modifications, just open the script in any Powershell and run. It will ask you TWICE for credentials. Just follow the prompts:
