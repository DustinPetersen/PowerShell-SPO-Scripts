A simple script for SharePoint Online to get all site collection features activated at a particular site collection.
 
Before running the script, verify the paths to SharePoint Online SDK:

```PowerShell
Add-Type -Path "c:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\15\ISAPI\Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll"  
Add-Type -Path "c:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\15\ISAPI\Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll"  
 ```

Optionally, you can edit these two lines so that the script doesn'task you for credentials at runtime:

```PowerShell
$siteUrl = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/mysitecollection‚Äù 
$username = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter admin@tenant.onmicrosoft.com"
``` 
 

During its execution the script will inform you what features are activated in a given site collection:
