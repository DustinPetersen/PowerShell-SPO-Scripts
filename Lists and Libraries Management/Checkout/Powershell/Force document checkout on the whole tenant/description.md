A short Powershell script which enables Checkout Requirement for all lists across all SPO site collections in an entire SharePoint Online tenant.

At the end a report is generated with all the lists for which the setting has been enabled.

It corresponds to the feature below:

<img src="../Force document checkout on the whole tenant/RequireCheckout.png">

For the lists in red, it was impossible to change the Checkout Requirement setting (by design they don't have such option).

The results:

<img src="../Force document checkout on the whole tenant/RequireCheckoutResults2.png">

For the lists in red, it was impossible to change the Checkout Requirement setting (by design they don't have such option).
